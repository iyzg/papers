# Learning Graph Cellular Automata

> In progress

Basic premise is that they want to study what happens if you take a GNN (graph neural network) and get it to simulate rules like a GCA (graph cellular automata). Specifically, if your message passing function is differentiable, then you're able to backprop and learn some sort of function.
