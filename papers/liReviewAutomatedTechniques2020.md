# Review: Automated techniques for monitoring the behaviour and welfare of broilers and laying hens: towards the goal of precision livestock farming

Although lots of work have been done on automating poultry, this paper wants to see whether the advancements are actually practical for industry which is different from the small lab environments where experiments are done. Specifically, they want to assess the feasibilty of *PLF* (precision livestock farming).

One thing I'm not using right now is audio which could be useful, as this review talks about how audio can be useful for predicting the weight of broilers. Interestingly, noise is a strong enough predictor to figure out whether liveestock have a disease or not too. Of course this faces issues like a large group of chickens and environmental noise, but if those could be filtered out effectively, then this could be a method of detecting broiler behavior.

An issue I see with this method, is I'm not sure the *latency* on the responses. Can it detect something that is almost about to happen? 

Interesting that for something more fast paced, people have used *optical flow* to tell whether chickens are distressed or not. You can check whether the distribution (say of walking speed) has significantly changed and that could detect abnormal behavior.

They mention a cool paper that combines a CNN with a Kinect camera which is able to detect flock behavior with an accuracy of 99%. Although it should be verified what exactly this accuracy is coming from.
