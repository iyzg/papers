# Delay, Detect, Defend: Preparing for a Future in which Thousands Can Release New Pandemics

> The world is demonstrably vulnerable to the introduction of a single pandemic virus with a comparatively low case fatality rate. The deliberate and simultaneous release of many pandemic viruses across travel hubs could threaten the stability of civilisation. Current trends suggest that within a decade, tens of thousands of skilled individuals will be able to access the information required for them to single-handedly cause new pandemics.

They note that right now, viruses spread faster than any distribution of vaccines or antivirals could ever be. Is there a way we could engineer antivirals to spread quickly to keep up while keeping them beneficial?
