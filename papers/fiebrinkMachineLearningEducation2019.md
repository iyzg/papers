# Machine Learning Education for Artists, Musicians, and Other Creative Practitioners

Paper about how we can better teach ML to creatives.

Really love this framing, except I think it is not only limited to artistic endeavors. Datasets always confer some sort of design or intention, and we're not thinking hard enough about what datasets we're giving these models. (insert meme about the Commoncrawl -> C4 -> Wikipedia pipeline)

Something I forget that this article brings up is that ML allows for *uncommon* interfaces! For example, hard to specify that you want lights to turn on when you move in *this* particular manner, but it is easy to train a model to perform. ML is useful for when you somehow have **in/out** readily available but don't have innards for creating the **out** behavior.

Generalization can sometimes be a *weak* metric in IML and creative endeavors since people might place a lot of points near decision, or they don't care about general adaptivity. Instead, maybe they're looking for something which acts surprisingly, or can handle common cases extremely well but breaks for the more weird ones.

It's really cool that the authors of the paper created interactice, graphical tools that allowed the users to quickly iterate on their intuitions. Especially for things like regressions and classification algorithms where they could hone in their ideas of what kinds of shapes they could be expected to make and how different data affected the algorithm. In using it as art, one has to be far more in-depth with the tool than someone simply using it as a ML system would have to be, although, perhaps both need that and this paper is saying something about the broader ML education.
