# Cognitive Science by Jose Bermudez

### 1.

The start of cognitive science was centered around whether or not behaviorism was correct. Did we only learn given rewards and punishments related to things?

This was a very popular theory for how learning occured and is still seen in modern RL theories, but this was disproven by rat maze experiments that showed rats can learn the layout of a maze without any explicit rewards.

From here on out, the "central dogma" of the field has been about how the brain is an information processor. We take in information, transform it, and choose to take actions with it. The other parts of this chapter cover Turing Machines and their inspiration on the field of cognitive science, how Chomsky plays a role by formally analyzing languages with syntax trees, and early psychology experiments surrounding this point of bits. The most well known of which is the 7 plus or minus 2 bits for how much short term memory humans have. Against the backdrop of computers having gigabytes of RAM these days, this seems quite pathetic, but this does seem to be how much we're able to keep track of one time. 

With more computer analogies, it's worth noting that you can use [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)) (store a pointer almost to somewhere in longer term memory) to increase your short term memory abilities.

Also interesting note that these experiments are all around this notion that our brain is in *bits*.
